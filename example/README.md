The following example is based on a set of demos written in C, of which a single demo has been ported to Zig.
The original C code can be found at https://github.com/TheSpydog/SDL_gpu_examples
See the license in the same directory as this file for the license relating to usage of that code, and by relation, the usage of the ported zig code.

To enable building the demo, you'll need to set these two options to true as part of the build:
* "build_demo"
* "sdl_shader"
See the build.zig for more info.
